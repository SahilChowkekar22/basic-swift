## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Datatypes and Collections in Swift

This assignment focuses on fundamental data structures and collections in Swift, including:

- **Basic Data Types**: Integers, Doubles, Booleans, Strings
- **Collections**: Arrays, Dictionaries, Sets
- **Type Inference and Type Safety**
- **Mutability and Immutability**

#### Key Concepts:

- Declaring and initializing variables and constants
- Using different collection types effectively
- Understanding value types and reference types
- Iterating over collections using loops

---

### Assignment 2: Swift Programming Concepts

This assignment expands on core Swift concepts and introduces control flow, functions, tuples, and optional handling.

#### Files Included:

- **ControlFlowExamples.playground**: Covers conditional statements (`if`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `repeat-while`).
- **FunctionsAndTuples.playground**: Demonstrates function declarations, parameter passing, return types, and the usage of tuples.
- **OptionalHandling.playground**: Explores optionals, optional binding, and handling `nil` safely in Swift.

#### Key Concepts:

- Writing reusable and efficient functions
- Handling control flow for decision-making
- Using tuples for returning multiple values
- Working with optionals to prevent runtime errors

### Assignment 3: Advanced Swift - Classes, Structures, Protocols, Extensions, and Optional Chaining

This assignment delves into more advanced Swift topics, providing a deeper understanding of object-oriented and protocol-oriented programming paradigms.

#### Files Included:

- **ClassesAndObject.playground**: Demonstrates the definition and usage of classes and objects, highlighting their properties, methods, and initializers.
- **Struct.playground**: Explores structures in Swift, emphasizing their value-type behavior, properties, and methods.
- **Protocol.playground**: Covers the definition and adoption of protocols, illustrating how they define blueprints for methods and properties.
- **Extension.playground**: Shows how to extend existing types with new functionality, including methods, computed properties, and protocol conformances.
- **OptionalChaining.playground**: Provides examples of optional chaining to safely access properties, methods, and subscripts of optional values.
- **TypesOfProperties.playground**: Discusses different property types in Swift, such as stored properties, computed properties, lazy properties, and property observers.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Classes and Objects**: Reference types that support inheritance, enabling the creation of complex hierarchies.
- **Structures**: Value types that are copied upon assignment, suitable for encapsulating simple data values.
- **Protocols**: Blueprints that define methods, properties, and other requirements for conforming types, facilitating a flexible and decoupled code structure.
- **Extensions**: Mechanisms to add new functionality to existing types without modifying their source code, enhancing code organization.
- **Optional Chaining**: A process for querying and calling properties, methods, and subscripts on optional values that might currently be `nil`, providing a concise and safe syntax.
- **Types of Properties**: Understanding various property types in Swift, including stored and computed properties, as well as property observers.
