### Assignment 2: Swift Programming Concepts

This assignment expands on core Swift concepts and introduces control flow, functions, tuples, and optional handling.

#### Files Included:

- **ControlFlowExamples.playground**: Covers conditional statements (`if`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `repeat-while`).
- **FunctionsAndTuples.playground**: Demonstrates function declarations, parameter passing, return types, and the usage of tuples.
- **OptionalHandling.playground**: Explores optionals, optional binding, and handling `nil` safely in Swift.

#### Key Concepts:

- Writing reusable and efficient functions
- Handling control flow for decision-making
- Using tuples for returning multiple values
- Working with optionals to prevent runtime errors
